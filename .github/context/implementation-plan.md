# Implementation Plan

Project Goal: Develop a modern, extensible Luau linter that provides plugin support, autofix capabilities, cross-file analysis, and excellent developer experience, addressing limitations of existing tools like Selene.

## Architecture Decisions Overview

**Core Architecture:** Listener Pattern for rule implementation has been chosen over Visitor Pattern for optimal developer experience and performance. See comprehensive design documents in `.github/reports/architecture/` for detailed specifications.

**Key Design Documents:**
- **Rule Pattern Decision:** `.github/reports/architecture/rule-pattern-decision.md` - Rationale for listener pattern choice
- **API Interfaces:** `.github/reports/architecture/api-interfaces.md` - Complete interface definitions
- **Listener Implementation:** `.github/reports/architecture/listener-pattern.md` - Technical implementation details
- **Rule Development Guide:** `docs/guides/writing-rules.md` - Comprehensive guide for rule authors

**Performance Strategy:** Single-pass AST traversal with batched rule execution (multiple rules per node type) for optimal performance with 200+ rules.

## Memory Bank Configuration
**Approved System:** Multi-file directory structure (`.github/memory/`) with phase-based organization due to project complexity, multiple specialized tasks, and long-term development requirements.

## Dependencies and Coordination Notes

**Critical Path:** Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4
**Parallel Opportunities:**
- Task 1.2 (Testing) can run parallel with Task 1.1 after basic architecture
- Task 2.2 (Rule Engine) can start after Task 2.1 listener pattern API is implemented
- Task 4.1 (Documentation) can begin early and continue throughout
- Performance optimization (Task 3.3) can be ongoing

**Key Integration Points:**
- **Listener Pattern API** (Task 2.1) must be implemented before rule engine (Task 2.2) and built-in rules (Task 2.3)
- **Autofix engine** (Task 3.1) requires stable RuleContext and fix creation infrastructure from listener pattern
- **Cross-file analysis** (Task 3.2) needs core architecture from Phase 1 and rule engine from Phase 2
- **IDE integration** (Task 4.2) depends on stable CLI, plugin system, and LintIssue format

**Architecture Decisions Made:**
- **Listener Pattern** chosen over Visitor Pattern for rule implementation (see `.github/reports/architecture/rule-pattern-decision.md`)
- **API interfaces** defined for Rule, RuleContext, and LintIssue (see `.github/reports/architecture/api-interfaces.md`)
- **Single-pass traversal** with batched rule execution for performance optimization
- **RuleContext utilities** provide comprehensive AST manipulation and reporting capabilities

**Lute Dependency Management:** All agents must coordinate with Lute version updates and ensure compatibility with official Luau parser changes while maintaining the listener pattern abstraction.
