## Dependencies and Coordination Notes

**Critical Path:** Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4
**Parallel Opportunities:**
- Task 1.2 (Testing) can run parallel with Task 1.1 after basic architecture
- Task 2.2 (Rule Engine) can start after Task 2.1 API design is complete
- Task 4.1 (Documentation) can begin early and continue throughout
- Performance optimization (Task 3.3) can be ongoing

**Key Integration Points:**
- Plugin API design (Task 2.1) must be finalized before built-in rules (Task 2.3)
- Autofix engine (Task 3.1) requires stable rule engine (Task 2.2)
- Cross-file analysis (Task 3.2) needs core architecture from Phase 1
- IDE integration (Task 4.2) depends on stable CLI and plugin system

**Lute Dependency Management:** All agents must coordinate with Lute version updates and ensure compatibility with official Luau parser changes.
