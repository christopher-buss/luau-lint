# Modern Linter Architecture Research Insights
**Date**: 2025-06-05
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Plugin System Design Research

## Key Findings from Modern Linter Architectures

### Rust-Based Performance Breakthroughs
- **Oxc**: 50-100x faster than ESLint through Rust implementation and unified parsing
- **Clippy**: Declarative syntax patterns reduce rule complexity vs imperative visitor code
- **Performance Pattern**: Arena allocation + parallel processing with dependency resolution

### Query-Based Rule Systems
- **Tree-sitter**: Declarative S-expression queries `(function_declaration name: (identifier) @name)`
- **Pattern**: Rules as patterns rather than imperative visitor traversals
- **Benefit**: More intuitive for common lint patterns, easier rule composition

### Incremental Computation Innovations
- **Rust-analyzer**: Salsa-based query memoization with automatic cache invalidation
- **TypeScript 2025**: Native Go port promising 10x performance improvements
- **Pattern**: Demand-driven analysis (only compute what's needed when needed)

### Key Architectural Insights

1. **Multi-Pass Execution**: ESLint's proven pattern handles rule conflicts correctly
2. **Unified AST Processing**: Single parse tree shared across all rules (not per-rule parsing)
3. **Incremental Cache Invalidation**: Track dependencies for minimal recomputation
4. **Declarative + Imperative**: Hybrid approach supports both patterns

## Updated Plugin API Recommendation

**Progressive Hybrid Approach**:
1. **Phase 1**: Enhanced ESLint-style foundation with multi-pass execution
2. **Phase 2**: Add query-based rule support for declarative patterns  
3. **Phase 3**: Incremental computation engine with workspace-level caching

**Key Decision**: Start with proven ESLint patterns + modern optimizations, evolve toward query-based rules

## Modern Patterns to Adopt Immediately
- Multi-pass execution model (correctness)
- Unified AST representation (performance)
- Rule result caching with content-based invalidation
- Efficient batching by AST node type

## Modern Patterns to Research Further
- Query-based declarative rule definition
- Rust-analyzer style incremental computation
- Language server protocol deep integration
- Arena allocation patterns (if applicable to Luau runtime)

## Impact on Our Design
- Updated Plugin API Design Document with 4th alternative (Query-Based Architecture)
- Comprehensive performance analysis of different execution strategies
- Progressive implementation roadmap balancing innovation with stability
- Research-informed recommendations replacing initial simple batching approach

**Status**: Modern linter research complete. Ready to proceed with enhanced ESLint-style foundation implementation.
