# APM Project Memory Bank Directory

This directory houses the detailed log files for the Luau Linter project.

## Location
This Memory Bank is located at `.github/memory/` as part of the project's APM framework organization under the `.github/` directory.

## Structure:

Logs are organized into subdirectories corresponding to each Phase in the `.github/context/implementation-plan.md`:
- `Phase_1_Foundation/` - Core architecture and testing infrastructure logs
- `Phase_2_Plugin_System/` - Plugin API, rule engine, and built-in rules logs  
- `Phase_3_Advanced_Features/` - Autofix, cross-file analysis, and performance logs
- `Phase_4_Developer_Experience/` - Documentation, IDE integration, and production logs

Within each phase directory, individual `.md` files capture logs for specific tasks as defined in the Implementation Plan.

All log entries within these files adhere to the format defined in `.github/prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`.
