# APM Task Assignment: Plugin API Architecture Design (Exploration Phase)

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

**Introduction:** You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the **Luau Linter** project.

**Your Role:** As an Implementation Agent, you are responsible for executing assigned tasks diligently, following the technical specifications provided, adhering to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, and logging your work meticulously to maintain project continuity and enable effective handovers.

**Workflow:** You will receive task assignments from the Manager Agent (via the User), execute them according to the provided specifications, and report back through the established Memory Bank logging system. Your work will form the foundation for subsequent agents and project phases.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) Requirements:** This project follows strict TDD principles as outlined in `.github/instructions/test_driven_development.instructions.md`. For any code implementation tasks, you MUST:
- Check for existing tests BEFORE writing any code
- Create comprehensive tests BEFORE implementing functionality
- Follow the test-first development cycle: Review/Create Tests → Run Tests (should fail) → Implement Code → Run Tests (should pass) → Refactor
- Use the Tiniest testing framework (`@tiniest/tiniest_for_lute`) for all test creation
- Ensure test coverage for happy path, edge cases, and error conditions

## 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Requirements

**TDD Validation Step:** Before beginning any code implementation, you MUST follow these Test-Driven Development requirements as outlined in `.github/instructions/test_driven_development.instructions.md`:

**Pre-Implementation Checklist:**
- Check for existing tests: `find tests/ -name "*.luau" | grep plugin`
- Review any existing test files for patterns and coverage
- Identify gaps in test coverage for your assigned task

**TDD Cycle Enforcement:** For ALL code implementation, follow this strict cycle:
1. **Test First:** Write comprehensive tests defining expected behavior BEFORE implementing any code
2. **Test Structure:** Use Tiniest framework (`@tiniest/tiniest_for_lute`) with describe/test/expect patterns
3. **Run Tests:** Execute tests to ensure they fail initially (red phase)
4. **Implement:** Write minimal code to make tests pass (green phase)
5. **Refactor:** Improve code while keeping tests green

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Happy path scenarios for plugin API components
- Edge cases and boundary conditions for plugin loading
- Error conditions and invalid plugin configurations
- Integration points with core linter components

**Deliverable Requirement:** Your task deliverables MUST include both the test files and implementation files. Tests are not optional.

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 2, Task 2.1, Item 1` in the Implementation Plan (`.github/context/implementation-plan.md`).

**Objective:** Design plugin API architecture with a focus on exploration and iterative design validation. This is an **EXPLORATION PHASE** - prioritize thorough design documentation and API experimentation over complete implementation.

**CRITICAL APPROACH:** This task emphasizes **exploration and validation** over full implementation. You should:
- Create detailed design proposals for review
- Build minimal working prototypes for concept validation
- Focus on API ergonomics and developer experience
- Seek feedback opportunities before proceeding to full implementation

**Detailed Action Steps:**

You must design and document the following plugin API architecture components:

1. **Plugin Interface and Lifecycle Hooks Design:**
   - **EXPLORATION FOCUS:** Research and document ESLint plugin patterns that should be adapted for Luau
   - Design the core plugin interface structure (initialization, configuration, rule registration)
   - Define plugin lifecycle hooks (onLoad, onConfigure, onRegisterRules, onDestroy)
   - Plan plugin metadata schema (name, version, description, author, dependencies)
   - Create multiple API design alternatives for comparison and validation
   - **Guidance:** Follow ESLint plugin patterns for familiarity while adapting to Luau specifics and Lute runtime

2. **Rule Registration and Discovery Mechanisms Design:**
   - Design rule registration API that feels intuitive for plugin authors
   - Plan rule discovery mechanisms (file-based, programmatic registration)
   - Design rule categorization system (style, correctness, performance, security)
   - Define rule metadata structure (severity levels, fix availability, documentation)
   - Create example plugin structures showing different rule types

3. **AST Visitor Pattern API Design:**
   - **EXPLORATION FOCUS:** Design visitor pattern API that may use Lute's visitor system as reference but prioritizes optimal rule execution
   - **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Design a system where multiple rules can efficiently execute on the same AST node type in a single pass (avoid re-parsing files for each rule)
   - Plan AST node type filtering and selection mechanisms that allow rule batching
   - Design context passing for rule execution (file info, configuration, utilities)
   - Create helper function patterns for common AST operations
   - Define error reporting and diagnostic creation APIs
   - **Performance Goal:** Collate all rules that need to visit specific node types (e.g., if 7 rules implement 'visitIfExpression', run all 7 during a single AST traversal)

4. **Plugin Configuration and Options System Design:**
   - Design plugin-specific configuration schema definition
   - Plan configuration validation and type checking mechanisms
   - Design configuration inheritance (global, project, rule-specific)
   - Define configuration error handling and user feedback
   - Create examples of complex plugin configurations

**Provide Necessary Context/Assets:**

- **Project Context:** This is a modern Luau linter aimed at providing ESLint-like extensibility while addressing limitations of existing tools like Selene
- **Technical Foundation:** Built on Lute runtime with access to official Luau parser and established visitor patterns
- **Existing Assets:** Reference the working POC in `examples/concept.luau` for established patterns and existing visitor usage
- **Lute Visitor Reference:** Study the existing visitor pattern in `lute/batteries/syntax/visitor.luau` as a reference point, but feel free to design a custom implementation for optimal rule batching
- **ESLint Reference:** Study ESLint's plugin API for familiar patterns that should be adapted to Luau/Lute context
- **Target Users:** Plugin authors who want ESLint-like development experience but for Luau code
- **Performance Priority:** Users should only need to specify which AST node types they care about and receive callbacks during traversal, without worrying about parsing efficiency

**Constraints:**
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing Lute setup but can implement custom visitor patterns for optimal performance
- API design must be intuitive for developers familiar with ESLint plugins
- Must support future autofix capabilities (Phase 3) in the API design
- Should leverage Lute's performance characteristics and not add unnecessary overhead
- **PERFORMANCE CONSTRAINT:** Visitor pattern must support efficient rule batching (multiple rules per AST node type in single pass)
- **EXPLORATION CONSTRAINT:** Focus on design validation over complete implementation

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:** Successful completion means producing comprehensive API design documentation with multiple alternatives, working prototypes for concept validation, and clear recommendations for the final API structure. This is exploration-focused - depth of design consideration is more valuable than implementation completeness.

**Specify Deliverables:** 
1. **Plugin API Design Document** (`.github/reports/plugin-api-design.md`) containing:
   - Multiple API design alternatives with pros/cons analysis
   - Detailed interface specifications with TypeScript-style definitions
   - Plugin lifecycle flow diagrams and examples
   - ESLint comparison showing adaptations for Luau context
   - Developer experience analysis and usability considerations
   - Performance analysis of visitor pattern approaches (Lute's vs custom implementation)

2. **Working Prototype Examples:**
   - Minimal plugin interface prototype (`.github/reports/prototypes/`)
   - Example plugin implementations showing different rule types
   - Configuration system prototype with validation examples
   - AST visitor API demonstration with rule batching examples
   - Performance comparison prototypes (single-pass vs multi-pass rule execution)

3. **API Documentation Samples:**
   - Plugin author getting started guide draft (`.github/reports/plugin-development-guide.md`)
   - Rule development examples and patterns
   - Configuration schema documentation with examples
   - Error handling and debugging guidance for plugin authors

4. **Test Files** (for implemented prototypes):
   - Comprehensive test coverage using Tiniest framework
   - Test files following the naming convention: `*_test.luau`
   - Test coverage for prototype components and API examples

5. **Design Validation Report:**
   - Comparison with ESLint patterns and Luau-specific adaptations
   - Performance considerations and visitor pattern analysis (custom vs Lute's implementation)
   - Recommendations for final API structure
   - Identified areas requiring user feedback before full implementation

**Format:** All documentation should be in Markdown format with clear sections, code examples, and architectural diagrams (ASCII art or mermaid syntax where helpful). Emphasize clarity for stakeholder review and validation.

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

**Instruction:** Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's Memory Bank file at `.github/memory/Phase_2_Plugin_System/Task_2_1_Plugin_API_Log.md`.

**Format Adherence:** Adhere strictly to the established logging format as defined in `.github/prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to the assigned task `Phase 2, Task 2.1, Item 1` in the Implementation Plan
- A clear description of the plugin API design decisions made
- Key design documents and prototypes created
- Analysis of different API design alternatives considered
- Recommendations for stakeholder review and next steps
- Links to created files and documentation
- Test coverage information for implemented prototypes
- Specific areas identified for user feedback and validation

## 6. Clarification Instruction

**Instruction:** If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding. The plugin API design is critical to the entire extensibility system, and this exploration phase is essential for getting the API right before full implementation.

**Validation Points:** This is an exploration task - please provide intermediate design proposals for review before proceeding to implementation. Focus on creating multiple design alternatives that can be evaluated for usability and technical merit.
