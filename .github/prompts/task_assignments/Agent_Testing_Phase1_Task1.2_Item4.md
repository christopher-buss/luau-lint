# APM Task Assignment: Integration Test Scenarios Planning (Phase 1.2.4)

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

**Introduction:** You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the Luau Linter project.

**Your Role:** You are Agent_Testing, responsible for executing testing infrastructure tasks diligently, following TDD principles, and logging work meticulously to ensure comprehensive test coverage and quality assurance for the linter system.

**Workflow:** You will interact with the Manager Agent (via the User) and contribute to the Memory Bank system to maintain continuity across the testing infrastructure development.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) Requirements:** All testing infrastructure and scenario planning must follow the TDD principles as outlined in `.github/instructions/test_driven_development.instructions.md`.

## 2. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work

**Current Project State:**
- **Phase 2 Plugin API (Task 2.1):** Successfully completed with comprehensive implementation including Rule interface, RuleRegistry, RuleEngine, and RuleContext with 35 passing tests
- **Existing Test Infrastructure:** Basic test framework using Tiniest (`@tiniest/tiniest_for_lute`) with test structure in `tests/` directory
- **Current Test Coverage:** Plugin system has 90%+ test coverage with dedicated test files in `tests/plugin/`
- **Available Test Fixtures:** Basic fixtures exist in `tests/fixtures/` including `good_code.luau`, `bad_code.luau`, `modern_code.luau`, etc.

**Key Context:**
- The project has a working plugin system but lacks the foundational Phase 1 core architecture
- Integration testing needs to bridge the gap between the implemented plugin system and the pending core linter foundation
- Current working components: Plugin API, Rule system, AST utilities via RuleContext
- Missing components: CLI interface, file processing pipeline, configuration system

## 3. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Requirements

**TDD Validation Step:** Before beginning any test scenario planning, you MUST follow these Test-Driven Development requirements as outlined in `.github/instructions/test_driven_development.instructions.md`:

**Pre-Implementation Checklist:**
- Check for existing integration tests: `find tests/ -name "*.luau" | grep -i integration`
- Review existing test structure in `tests/` directory for patterns and organization
- Examine current test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` for expansion opportunities
- Identify integration test gaps between plugin system and core architecture

**TDD Cycle Enforcement:** For ALL integration test scenario planning, follow this strict cycle:
1. **Test First:** Define integration test scenarios and expected behaviors BEFORE creating test infrastructure
2. **Test Structure:** Use Tiniest framework (`@tiniest/tiniest_for_lute`) with describe/test/expect patterns matching existing plugin tests
3. **Scenario Definition:** Write comprehensive integration scenarios covering happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
4. **Implementation Planning:** Plan test infrastructure to support the scenarios
5. **Validation Framework:** Design validation mechanisms for complex integration flows

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- End-to-end linting workflows (file input → rule execution → issue output)
- Plugin system integration with future core components
- Error handling across system boundaries
- Performance testing for multi-file scenarios
- Configuration system integration points

**Deliverable Requirement:** Your task deliverables MUST include both the integration test scenario plans AND the infrastructure design to support them. Scenarios are not optional.

## 4. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 1, Task 1.2, Sub-component 4` in the Implementation Plan: "Plan integration test scenarios."

**Objective:** Design comprehensive integration test scenarios that validate the interaction between the existing plugin system and the pending core linter foundation, creating a roadmap for end-to-end testing that will enable a working example of the current codebase.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Analyze Current System Integration Points**
   - Review the completed plugin system architecture in `src/plugin/` directory
   - Examine the plugin API interfaces and determine integration requirements with core components
   - Identify the bridge points between plugin system and pending Phase 1 foundation (CLI, file processing, configuration)
   - Map out the data flow from file input through rule execution to issue output

2. **Design End-to-End Integration Scenarios**
   - **Primary Scenario:** File processing pipeline integration
     - Input: Luau source files with various code patterns
     - Processing: AST parsing → rule engine execution → issue collection
     - Output: Formatted lint results with fixes
   - **Configuration Integration Scenario:** Rule configuration and plugin loading
     - Test cascading configuration system with plugin rule enabling/disabling
     - Validate configuration merging from multiple sources
   - **Error Handling Integration Scenario:** Graceful failure across system boundaries
     - Test file reading errors, AST parsing failures, rule execution errors
     - Validate error recovery and user-friendly error reporting

3. **Create Working Example Integration Test Plan**
   - Design a minimal but complete linting workflow that exercises existing plugin system
   - Plan test scenarios that can work with current codebase and mock missing components
   - Create integration test structure that can evolve as Phase 1 foundation is implemented
   - Define test data requirements for comprehensive scenario coverage

4. **Plan Integration Test Infrastructure**
   - Design test harness for end-to-end scenarios using existing Tiniest framework
   - Plan mock implementations for missing core components (CLI, file processor, config system)
   - Create integration test organization within existing `tests/` directory structure
   - Design test utilities for complex multi-component validation

5. **Define Integration Test Data and Fixtures**
   - Expand on existing `tests/fixtures/` to support integration scenarios
   - Plan test file collections for different complexity levels (single file, multi-file, large projects)
   - Design configuration test files for various rule combinations
   - Create expected output fixtures for validation

**Provide Necessary Context/Assets:**
- **Existing Plugin System:** Reference `src/plugin/` directory for API interfaces and implementation
- **Current Test Framework:** Use `tests/plugin/` as pattern for integration test structure
- **Test Fixtures:** Build upon `tests/fixtures/` directory for comprehensive test data
- **Documentation:** Reference `.github/reports/architecture/` for plugin system design details

**Constraints:**
- Integration tests must work with current plugin system implementation
- Must account for missing Phase 1 foundation by planning mock implementations
- Should follow existing test patterns and directory structure
- Must enable creation of a working example demonstrating current capabilities

## 5. Expected Output & Deliverables

## 6. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

**Instruction:** Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's Memory Bank system.

**Format Adherence:** Create a new memory bank entry at `.github/memory/Phase_1_Foundation/Task_1_2_Testing_Infrastructure/Integration_Test_Scenarios_Log.md` following the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- Reference to Phase 1, Task 1.2, Item 4 in the Implementation Plan
- Clear description of integration scenarios planned and infrastructure designed
- Key decisions made regarding test organization and mock component approach
- Cross-references to deliverable documents created
- Summary of how integration tests will enable working example creation
- Confirmation of successful planning completion

**Integration with Existing Work:** Reference the completed Plugin API work from Phase 2 and how integration scenarios bridge to pending Phase 1 foundation work.

## 7. Clarification Instruction

**Instruction:** If any part of this task assignment is unclear, particularly regarding the balance between testing current plugin system capabilities and planning for missing foundation components, please state your specific questions before proceeding.

**Note:** This task is critical for demonstrating the value of work completed so far and providing a clear testing roadmap for future development. Focus on creating comprehensive scenarios that can showcase the plugin system's capabilities while planning for full integration as the core foundation is implemented.
